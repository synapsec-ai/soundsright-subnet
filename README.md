<h1 align="center">Bittensor's Speech Enhancement Subnet</h1>

If you are unfamiliar with how Bittensor works, please check out [this primer](https://docs.bittensor.com/learn/bittensor-building-blocks) first!

The SoundsRight subnet is focused on the research and development of speech enhancement models through daily fine-tuning competitions, powered by the decentralized Bittensor ecosystem. 

Miners in the subnet will upload their fine-tuned models to HuggingFace, and the subnet's validators are in charge of downloading the models and benchmarking their performance.

**Each competition is winner-takes-all.**

<h1 align="center">Getting Started</h1>

To get started with mining or validating in the subnet, please reference the [subnet documentation]("https://docs.soundsright.ai").

Additionally, if you would like to start in testnet, SoundsRight is testnet 271.
