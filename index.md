<h1 align="center">Bittensor's Speech Enhancement Subnet</h1>

If you are unfamiliar with how Bittensor works, please check out [this primer](https://docs.bittensor.com/learn/bittensor-building-blocks) first!

The SoundsRight subnet promotes the research and development of speech enhancement models through two-day fine-tuning competitions, powered by the decentralized Bittensor ecosystem. 

Miners in the subnet will upload their fine-tuned models to HuggingFace, and the subnet's validators are in charge of downloading the models, benchmarking their performance and determining the best model. 

**Each competition is winner-takes-most.**

<h1 align="center">Fine-Tuning Competitions</h1>

The table below outlines the two-day competitions currently being held by the subnet. Competitions are distinguished by the sample rate of the testing data, the task and the metric used for benchmarking.

| Sample Rate | Task | Benchmarking Metric | % of Total Weights | 
| ----------- | ---- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| 16 kHz | Denoising | PESQ | 15 |
| 16 kHz | Denoising | ESTOI | 12.5 |
| 16 kHz | Denoising | SI-SDR | 7.5 |
| 16 kHz | Denoising | SI-SAR | 7.5 |
| 16 kHz | Denoising | SI-SIR | 7.5 |
| 16 kHz | Dereverberation | PESQ | 15 |
| 16 kHz | Dereverberation | ESTOI | 12.5 |
| 16 kHz | Dereverberation | SI-SDR | 7.5 |
| 16 kHz | Dereverberation | SI-SAR | 7.5 |
| 16 kHz | Dereverberation | SI-SIR | 7.5 |
